A quick lil java class I spun up to brush up on the language before CSE 11 at UCSD.

I'm also taking MATH 18 so why not do some matrix operations and stuff?

To use this class, clone the repo to your computer and read the [docs](https://github.com/x0ba/java-matrix.git). 

Alternatively, use the CLI wrapper by compiling and running the MatrixCalculator.java file:

```bash
  javac MatrixCalculator.java Matrix.java
  java MatrixCalculator
  ```
```
